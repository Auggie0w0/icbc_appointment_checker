    cd icbc-appointment-checker
    ```

2. Install the required Python libraries:

    cp config.yml.example config.yml
    ```

2. Edit the `config.yml` file with your own details:

    ```yaml
    icbc:
      drvrLastName: "YourLastName"
      licenceNumber: "YourLicenceNumber"
      keyword: "YourKeyword"
      expactAfterDate: "2024-05-01"

      expactBeforeTime: "17:00"
      examClass: "5"
      posID: 273
      prfDaysOfWeek: "[0,1,2,3,4,5,6]"
      prfPartsOfDay: "[0,1]"

    email:
      smtp_server: "smtp.your-email-provider.com"
      smtp_port: 587
      sender_address: "your_email@provider.com"
      sender_pass: "your_application_specific_password"
      receiver_addresses:
        - "receiver1_email@provider.com"
        - "receiver2_email@provider.com"
    ```

## Usage

Run the script with the specified config file:

    ```bash
    python icbc_appointment_checker.py config.yml
    ```

## Scheduling with Crontab

To schedule the script to run at regular intervals, you can use `crontab`. Hereâ€™s how to set it up:

1. Open the crontab editor:

    ```bash
    crontab -e
    ```

2. Add a new line to schedule the script. For example, to run the script every hour, add:

    ```bash
    0 * * * * /usr/bin/python3 /path/to/icbc_appointment_checker.py /path/to/config.yml
    ```

    Replace `/usr/bin/python3` with the path to your Python 3 executable, and `/path/to/icbc_appointment_checker.py` and `/path/to/config.yml` with the correct paths to the script and configuration file.

3. Save and exit the editor.

The script will now run every hour and check for available ICBC appointments and send email notifications to the specified recipients if there are any changes.
